 * This program reads a sorted array from a file and finds a requested number
 *    using recursive or iterative binary search. The array is read from a file
 *    defined by FILE_NAME, which should be written as the number of elements
 *    followed by the elements themselses. each number can be deliniated with
 *    any whitepace character. Also, the maximum size of the array is defined 
 *    as MAX_SIZE.
 * 
 * NOTE: The array must be sorted!!
